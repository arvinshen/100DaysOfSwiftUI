<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Guess the Flag is a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world.

#### [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/guess-the-flag-wrap-up)
>1. Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert and in the score label.
>2. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.
>3. Make the game show only 8 questions, at which point they see a final alert judging their score and can restart the game.
>
>Note: That last one takes a little more thinking than the others. A good place to start would be to add a second alert() modifier watching a different Boolean property, then connect its button to a reset() method to set the game back to its initial state.
