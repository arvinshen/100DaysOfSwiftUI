<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Drawing is a technique project focusing on drawing.

#### [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/drawing-wrap-up)
>1. Create an Arrow shape â€“ having it point straight up is fine. This could be a rectangle/triangle-style arrow, or perhaps three lines, or maybe something else depending on what kind of arrow you want to draw.
>2. Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.
>3. Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is the rectangular cousin of ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using one or more properties.
>
>Tip: Gradient positions like .top and .bottom are actually instances of UnitPoint, and you can create your own UnitPoint instances with X/Y values ranging from 0 to 1.
