<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Word Scramble is an app that asks users to make words with the letters of a given word (i.e. make anagrams out of a word).

#### [Challenges](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/word-scramble-wrap-up)
>1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
>2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
>3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the playerâ€™s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
